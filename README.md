I was fortunate that BU exposed me to a VERY, VERY wide range of research fields, as biomedical engineering is already an extremely broad field. I was eager to learn all these stuffs in my first year at BU, as is required of my Ph.D. program. Heck, having never took optics class before or any prior exposure to optics field, I learned optics in under 2 months, just enough to pass my qualifying exam on optics. However, as time flied, I realized that I only have finite energy and time and I really need to specialize in a field, instead of falling to "jack of all trade, master of none" trap. Furthermore, I easily forgot all the things I learned, including optics. This made me realized I wish I'm in a more specialized, traditional program like ECE instead of BME. But I'm already here and I made it this far. :)
